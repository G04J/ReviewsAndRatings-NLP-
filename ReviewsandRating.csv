3,"Specifications are only great on papers, 64mp camera doesn't fill like 64mp at all ... Work like 12mp camera. Performance is just OK, display also just above average and doesn't fill like 120hz refresh rate. Very average phone for this price. So OK you can go for it but not really value for money phone or as you expect a POCO phone.READ MORE"
4,Although it is a alrounder 5G phone in specs but the camera quality didn't satisfied me even not a decent 64 MP sensor peromance slow down due to the processor battery life is better and with 67 vault its a nice combination and the best part of the phone is its display i liked the display very much because its has 1200 nits peak brightness with 120htz refresh rate and 360 touch sampling its a best super amoled dispaly phone you can go for this if you can compromise with camera otherwise if wa...READ MORE

3,"Lagging on very normal usage. üëéVideo recording support only 1080p on 30fps in this price segment this is very bad.Display is very good. Battery and charging speed also good .Pubg graphics support on ultra in Smooth and high on hd in this price segment that worst. Performance also not good üëéCamera was not bad just okok Only good thing is that display , battery and 5g connectivity.READ MORE"
5,"The phone is value for money.The display is in league above the rest in this range.Processor is also good for the price range.2 seperate speakers and it gets loud and clear no distortion at high volume.Charging time is great even when compared to flagship phones.The only con for the phone is camera. It's really low quality even in this range.If your not into photography this is the best phone in the range, but if you prioritise camera this phone is not for you.READ MORE"
4,"Received the phone today. Thanks to Flipkart was super fast delivery. Ordered the yellow colour for my mom because it appeared classy. Inside the box, we had the phone, adaptor, case and original bill.  Well, i have two things to say. Yes, the handset actually looks good to the eyes and feels premium in hand. Battery is very good. I could see the phone charging up to 100% within 30 minutes and i used the phone throughout the day and it's still on 51%. Camera is Decent enough to make you cap...READ MORE"
4,"Phone's best part is its  body finish,stereo speakers and display...Phone fails to keep its promise of 60w fast charging,on average it takes one hour plus to charge upto 100 percent.Camera is average.Needs software fixes..Phone has two gigs of extended ram or virtual ram that makes it 8 gb ram too at the same time...Go for 128gb as 30 gigs is kept reserved by phones and softwares.Phone is not a bad deal,we can't have everything in our dish.So not disappointed with it as overall but it feel ba...READ MORE"
5,"Guys this is the best true amoled display other makers are fooling people's telling amoled but this is real amoled colors are punchy and display is bright enough just go for this multimedia, gaming purpose it's a treat...

5,I have to say this phone is very good I love it this phone did not lag but buy only the 128gb that will be really good and I want to ask some YouTubeer that thay said that this phone lag I don't see it and for gaming this phone is born from gaming you will find some problems in BGMI but in all the other games this phone works best . And yes the camara is good üëç but not that good but I still love it üíïüíï I will suggest you to buy it but it is all your choiceREAD MORE

3,"A good phone overall.I'm not fully satisfied by my phone's performance.

3,"This phone is a mid-range performance based device, with great display, good speakers, 3.5 mm audio jack (a necessity for any audiophile), and good battery backup.The camera module is just pathetic to say the least.I'm not into gaming so won't be discussing gaming in this review at all. Performance wise, multitasking is great, aggressive RAM management can be turned on and off for apps, so, one can keep apps in volatile memory according to one's needs. Speakers and 3.5 mm audio jack are g...READ MORE"

5,"The phone is great. Its a great value option for people who dont expect high end performance and gaming. Gives to decent yet powerful experience in performing the regular tasks. Camera could be better. Not an Hardware issue I guess, just the POCO team could provide with some OTA updates. Screen and speakers are a good combo. Great for multimedia consumption. In short: Good for the price. In 2022 the mid range market is full of expensive yet mediocre devices, where POCO tries to do a balancing...READ MORE"
